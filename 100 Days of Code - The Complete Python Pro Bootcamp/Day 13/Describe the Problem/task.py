my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? It wants to find a number (i) from range 1 through 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? if i reaches 20, then you got it right.
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? The value of i can be any number from 1 - 20.
